# ðŸ“˜ Project: lrhorfim â€” Optimized Algorithms in C & Assembly

This project explores **algorithm implementation and optimization** in both **C** and **x86 assembly**, focusing on data structures and sorting algorithms. It was developed as part of a programming course to gain hands-on experience with:

- Implementing and benchmarking algorithms in C  
- Translating and optimizing functions in assembly  
- Using **tail-call optimization** and other low-level improvements  
- Comparing performance between naive, optimized, and super-optimized versions  


### Requirements
- GCC (C compiler)  
- `make` (build automation tool)  
- `gdb` ( for debugging with `.gdbinit`)

ðŸ§ª Tests

The tp./test/ directory contains example inputs/outputs (.sortie) that can be used to verify correctness..

ðŸ“– Learning Outcomes

This project helps understand:
	â€¢	The differences between high-level C and low-level assembly
	â€¢	How optimizations (loop unrolling, tail-call optimization, etc.) affect performance
	â€¢	Practical use of Makefiles and structured testing
